# Starter Kernel
We started with Justin and Shane's kernel for this project.

# Description and how to run
Our project implements a basic file system with supporting operations, each with its own system call. Use 'make run' to make and run the program. After being prompted with "Hello User!", type test_mod to launch our demo module that displays file system operations.
